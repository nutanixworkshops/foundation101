Customer Walkthrough
====================

The cluster is up and running in the customer's environment and you should now spend time with them to demonstrate the simplicity of Nutanix.

A reminder... **The customer must accept EULA, NEVER the SE**

Topics to review
++++++++++++++++

Before reeling off your well learned Nutanix 'patter' remember why you're providing them with a cluster. There's obviously a test criteria and plan that will be followed so use this as the direction of the demonstration.

-   Prism Element, and perhaps Central if they plan to use the features of it

-   Storage creation, it's only a few clicks

-   Virtual Machine creation, cloning and management

-   Metrics and alerts, how these can be shown on the Analysis page

-   Cluster expansion, although that will more than likely wait until to a later point for the PoC

-   AOS rolling upgrade, the **one-click** updates - again, this may wait once the PoC is in use with workloads

-   Work back through the signed-off test plan you've agreed with the customer so it's clear from both sides what is expected

-   Agree review calls and return visits before leaving site, don't leave the customer on their own for this
